# Goals of This Section

## Goals of This Section

-   Define **Labour Economics**

-   Describe basic facts about the labour market

-   Introduce the main economic model used in labour economics

-   Discuss some current policy issues

# What is Labour Economics?

## Defining Labour Economics

-   **Labour Economics** is the study of the interaction between workers, employers, and government that determine outcomes like wages and employment

-   Key aspects of labour economics

    -   Labour supply: decisions by individuals about how much to work
    -   Labour demand: decisions by firms about how many workers to hire
    -   Labour market: the interaction of labour supply and demand that determines wages and employment
    -   Other determinants of wages: human capital, discrimination, unions, minimum wage, stc.
    -   Inequality and poverty: the distribution of income and wealth
    -   Unemployment: causes and consequences

## Labour Supply

-   Studies decisions by individuals about how much to work

-   There are many key determinants

    -   Wages: higher wages increase the opportunity cost of leisure, leading to more work
        -   Can also lead to *less* work if wages are already very high
    -   Non-labour income: higher non-labour income reduces the need to work, leading to less work
    -   Preferences: some people may prefer more leisure or more work
    -   Public policy: taxes, transfers, and regulations can affect labour supply
        -   Examples: income tax, welfare programs, minimum wage, pension, workers compensation

## Labour Demand

-   Studies decision by firms about how many workers to hire

-   Key determinants

    -   Wages: higher wages increase the cost of labour, leading to less hiring
    -   Other labour costs: benefits, training, and other costs increase the cost of labour, leading to less hiring
    -   Productivity: more productive workers are more valuable, leading to more hiring
    -   Output prices: higher output prices increase revenue, leading to more hiring
    -   Technology: new technology can change the demand for different types of workers
    -   Public policy: taxes, subsidies, and regulations can affect labour demand
        -   Examples: corporate tax, employment subsidies, minimum wage, occupational licensing

## Relative Wages

-   Across the economy, different groups of workers earn different wages

    -   Men earn more than women
    -   Education is positively related to wages
    -   More dangerous jobs tend to pay more
    -   Public sector jobs pay differently than private sector ones
    -   Immigrants earn less than non-immigrants

-   Labour economics uses supply, demand and other models to explain these differences

    -   Returns to schooling explained by **human capital theory**
    -   Gender and immigrant wage gaps partly explained by discrimination

## Unions

-   Unions are organizations that represent workers in collective bargaining with employers

-   Unions increase worker power, and can affect wages and employment

-   Typically wages of unionized workers are determined by **collective bargaining**

    -   Leads to a collective bargaining agreement, renegotiated every few years

-   To study unionized workers, labour economists incorporate bargaining theory into their models

-   Unions can also affect non-wage aspects of jobs, such as benefits, working conditions, and job security

## Unemployment

-   Most topics in labour economics use **microeconomic** models to explain behaviour

-   Unemployment is studied using both microeconomic and macroeconomic models

-   Typical microeconomic topics include:

    -   Job search: how workers find jobs and how firms find workers
    -   Implicit contracts: agreements between workers and firms that are not formal contracts
    -   Efficiency wages: wages that are above the market-clearing level to increase productivity and reduce turnover
    -   Employment insurance: government programs that provide income support to unemployed workers

## Unemployment

-   Typical macroeconomic topics include:

    -   Business cycles: fluctuations in economic activity that affect employment
    -   Inflation: the general increase in prices that can affect real wages and employment
    -   Productivity: the amount of output produced per worker that can affect wages and employment

# Basic Economic Model of the Labour Market

## Introduction

-   The basic economic model of the labour market is based on **supply and demand**

-   The labour market is an **input market**

    -   Firms demand labour to produce goods and services
    -   Workers supply labour in exchange for wages
    -   Different from **output markets** where firms supply goods and services, and consumers demand them

-   The interaction of labour supply and demand determines the equilibrium wage and employment level

-   We will cover the basics here, and fill in details through the course

## Competitive Labour Market

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Graph shows demand curve (ND) and supply curve (NS) for labour

-   Supply curve is upward sloping

    -   Shows how much labour people will sell at each wage **all else equal**

    -   The higher the wage, the higher the quantity of labour supplied

-   Demand curve is downward sloping

    -   Shows how much labour a firm wants to hire at each wage **all else equal**

    -   The higher the wage, the lower the quantity of labour demanded

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Equilibrium is where demand and supply interset

    -   Wage is W\* and level of employment is N\*

-   Why is this equilibrium?

    -   If W \> W\*, excess supply of labour

        -   Unemployed workers willing to work for less

        -   Puts downward pressure on wage

    -   If W \< W\*, excess demand for labour

        -   Firms cannot find enough workers

        -   Puts upward pressure on wage
:::
::::::

## Competitive Labour Market

-   There are some key considerations of this model

1.  Assumes many buyers and sellers

    -   No single firm or worker can influence the wage
    -   Need a different model for labour markets with a single buyer (monopsony)

2.  Implies no **involuntary unemployment**

    -   Everyone who wants to work at the equilibrium wage can find a job
    -   People who are unemployed are choosing to be
    -   Not very realistic because we know the involuntary unemployed exist

3.  Assumes homogeneous set of workers

    -   Same in terms of their productive characteristics

## Competitive Labour Market

-   An implication of homogeneous labour is that different sectors that hire the same labour pay them the same

-   Example: Nurses

    -   Nurses in hospitals and long-term care facilities have similar skills and training

    -   If hospitals pay more, nurses will leave long-term care to work in hospitals

    -   This will continue until wages are equalized

-   Other examples

    -   Teachers in public and private schools
    -   Electricians in construction and manufacturing
    -   Data scientists in tech firms and banks

## Competitive Labour Market

-   Graphs show a temprary imbalance in pay between hospitals and long-term care in the market for nurses

-  Right graph shows long term care paying more

- Over time nurses move from long term care to hospitals

    - Movement stops when wages are equalized
    
- Employment in long term care increases, employment in hospitals decreases

- Note that this depends on key assumptions

    - No barriers to moving between sectors
    - No differences in non-wage aspects of jobs
    - Homogeneous labour
    
- We will explore situation in course where these assumptions do not hold

# Current Policy Issues

## Introduction

- Most researchers in labour economics analyze various policy issues

    - Use data to estimate their effects
    - Some do experiments
    - Others (not many) create theoretical models

- There are many policies that affect workers and firms with respect to labour

    - In Canada they can be at the federal, provincial, or municipal level
    - Can be policies from other countries (e.g. U.S. tariffs)
    
- Below we outline some current issues

    - Helpful for the future if you want to write a 481 paper in this area

- Textbook has an extremely long list; we will cover a few here

## Issues in Labour Supply

- How does income tax affect employment?

- Do income support programs (e.g. welfare, Canada Worker Benefit) affect employment?

- How has the labour force participation of women changed over time?

- How do child care costs affect employment of mothers?

- How do pension programs affect retirement decisions?

- Do temporary foreign workers affect the wages of domestic workers?

## Issues in Labour Demand

- How do minimum wages affect employment?

- Do unions affect wages and employment?

- Does technological change (e.g. Automation, AI) reduce employment?

- Does uncertainty (e.g. Trump tariffs, Brexit) affect hiring/firing decisions?

- Do employment subsidies (e.g. Canada Summer Jobs program) increase employment?

## Issues in Wage Structures

- Why do men and women earn different wages? 

- Why do immigrants earn lower wages on entry?

- Do immigrant wages catch up after being in Canada for a while?

- What is the return to additional schooling?

- Do public sector workers earn more than private sector workers?

- Do workers in more dangerous jobs earn more?

- Why are CEOs paid so much?


## Issues in Unemployment

- What are the main causes of unemployment?

- How do unemployment insurance programs affect unemployment?

- How quickly does unemployment fall after a recession?

- How long to people typically stay unemployed

- Does long term unemployment hurt future job prospects?
